1. Code and problems (5 mins) 
	[] Show how we implemented both algorithms, but briefly and in a smart way:
		[] 2. Anna: smart MC step and Gibbs step
		[] 3. Theo: statistics (finding equlibrium, ... you know which is the interesting and important stuff Theo)
		[X] 1. Carmen: Total Energies , class structure and which are the available functions 
	[] discrepancies between totalE and e (included in "2. Anna")
	[X] how to understand the boundary conditions (included in "1. Carmen")
	(some of us interpreted the periodic boundary conditions as an infinite lattice, turned to be a torus)
	[] speed of the code - numba made it significantly faster ("2. Anna")
	[] gibbs probability distribution: the function one can normally use from python didtn work , we had to implement a new districution function (2.Anna)
	[] Gibbs energy-states distribution is still mirrored - we first thought it should follow the Bolztman-Maxwell   distribution but now we are not so sure. (Anna pictures)

2 Pictures (6 mins)
	[X] Carmen: Cold - Hot
		[X] all experiments of the same plot (temperature) lead to more or less the same energy
			(different tests have different t0)
		[X] hot start seems to be closer to equilibrium compared to cold start
			(at low temperature cold start is closer to equilibrium)
