#TODO
- Theo: create state plots in interesting cases (high energy, low energy)
- Theo: plot series with creation of maxwell distribution (modifying M)
- Theo: fix long git uploading times
- Anna: plot series of maxwell distribution based on temperature
- Anna: critical temperature plots: dependence on L
- Carmen: merge plot energy (theo) into plot energy (carmen)
- Carmen: hot-cold start comparison
